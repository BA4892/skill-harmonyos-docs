# skill-harmonyos-docs

An offline search repository for HarmonyOS development documentation that provides AI-assisted development tools (such as Claude Code Skills, CodeArts Doer, etc.) with the ability to quickly locate structured HarmonyOS development documentation.

## Project Overview

This project crawls and organizes the complete **API 23 (HarmonyOS 6.0)** development documentation from the official HarmonyOS developer documentation site. It covers three core sections: API Reference, Development Guides, and Best Practices, comprising a total of **18,932 documents** with a total content size of approximately **363 MB**.

The core design employs a **two-step retrieval method combining category directories and sub-indexes**: The AI first reads a very small category directory (1–3 KB) to determine the document’s category, then retrieves the corresponding sub-index as needed for precise location, avoiding the need to load large files all at once and significantly reducing token consumption.
